# MVO - TSP

Multi-Verse Optimization (MVO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the concept of multiple universes in astrophysics. In MVO, each solution to the problem is considered as a universe. The algorithm tries to find the best solution (universe) by updating its universes using wormholes. A wormhole is a connectionbetween two universes, and it helps to transfer information from one universe to another. The existence probability of wormholes decreases as the algorithm progresses.

The MVO algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. Initialize the universes (solutions) randomly.
2. Calculate the fitness of the universes.
3. For each iteration:
* Calculate the best and worst fitness values.
* Calculate the normalized fitness values.
* Calculate the updated wormhole probabilities.
* Update the universes by creating new universes using the wormhole probabilities.
* Update the wormhole existence probability.
4. Find the best solution among the universes.

In the provided implementation, I applied the MVO algorithm to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The algorithm starts with generating random tours as universes and evaluates their fitness using the total distance of the tours. The universes are updated by swapping two cities in the selected universe, and the new universe replaces the old one if it has better fitness. The algorithm converges to an optimal or near-optimal solution after a certain number of iterations.

## Sample Output:

Here's an example of what the output may look like:

```python
Best tour: [8, 21, 17, 15, 2, 11, 25, 0, 3, 10, 13, 12, 28, 5, 7, 19, 1, 18, 22, 14, 29, 6, 9, 20, 24, 26, 4, 23, 27, 16]
Best distance: 5.478589158744902
```

Note that the output may vary each time you run the code, as the algorithm starts with randomly generated tours and updates the universes using random probabilities.

The plot generated by the code shows the best tour found by the MVO algorithm for the TSP problem. The cities are represented by red dots, and the lines connecting the cities represent the order in which the salesman visits them.
